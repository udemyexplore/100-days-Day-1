## Day 1: Introduction to Python Basics
Welcome to Day 1 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023! This bootcamp is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Python programming and help you become a proficient Python developer.
## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of Python programming.
- Practice key concepts such as printing, debugging, input functions, and variables.
## Concepts Covered
1. Printing in Python.
2. Debugging your code.
3. Using the input function.
4. Storing and manipulating data using variables.
## Exercise 1: Printing
In Python, the `print()` function is used to display text or variables to the console. It is an essential tool for debugging and providing feedback to the user.
```python
# Example 1: Printing a simple message
print("Hello, world!")
# Output:
# Hello, world!
# Example 2: Printing multiple items
name = "John"
age = 25
print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")
# Output:
# My name is John and I am 25 years old.
```
## Exercise 2: Debugging Practice
Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in your code. Python provides useful tools and techniques to assist with debugging.
```python
# Example 1: Debugging syntax errors
print("This statement is missing a closing parenthesis"
# Output:
# SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
# Example 2: Debugging logic errors
a = 10
b = 5
result = a - b
print("The result is:", result)
```
## Exercise 3: Using the Input Function
The `input()` function allows you to prompt the user for input. It is helpful for creating interactive programs where user input is required.
```python
# Example 1: Taking input and storing it in a variable
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name, "!")
# Output:
# Enter your name: John
# Hello, John!
# Example 2: Concatenating multiple inputs
age = input("Enter your age: ")
country = input("Enter your country: ")
print("You are", age, "years old and from", country, ".")
```
## Exercise 4: Variables
Variables are used to store and manipulate data in Python. They can hold different types of values such as numbers, strings, or lists.
```python
# Example 1: Storing a number in a variable
age = 25
print("I am", age, "years old.")
# Output:
# I am 25 years old.
# Example 2: Storing a string in a variable
name = "John"
print("My name is", name)
# Output:
# My name is John
```
